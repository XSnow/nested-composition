This repository is built with Coq 8.6.1.

It requires `LibTatics.v` from [TLC](http://www.chargueraud.org/softs/tlc/), and
the 8.6 branch of [metalib](https://github.com/plclub/metalib). The former is
included in the directory. The latter can be installed via Github.

This work checks with Coq's native theory -- it includes no Axioms or other
extensions.
